## School's Submission System Explained

__For cs61bl students__

These days I heard a lot of people around asking about problems about the submission process and ssh. Those are all unix stuff, but most people are not used to Unix, so there may be wierd things happen like why I cannot copy files to the lab computer or why I submit a long list of files. In this post, I will try to explain all the concepts to help ease this summer's learning. I will not have illustrations but feel free to ask me any questions. BTW, I'm a student in Alice's section. 

### About lab's computer

Q: why we need an account to login to the lab computer?
